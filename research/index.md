Our current research on air quality modeling from local-scale to regional-scale, particularly focused on wildfires. 

### AIRPACT
AIRPACT is a regional air quality forecast over Pacific Northwest region. Please read about it [here](http://lar.wsu.edu/airpact/).

### AIRPACT-Fire
AIRPACT-Fire project is funded by Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) to improve wildfires-related air quality forecasting in AIRPACT modeling framework, to better estimate its health effects, and to enhance air quality forecast distributions.   

### Fire-SOA
Fire-SOA project is also funded by JFSP to study Secondary Organic Aerosols formation from wildfires using AIRPACT modeling system. 

### AQUICC (Air Quality In Changing Climate)
AQUICC project is funded by U.S. EPA to study future air quality in changing climate using statistically downscaled climate dataset, which is called MACA. We have developed a Langrangian air quality modeling framework that allows to simulate air quality with only a few key meteorological data.
