If you are a motivated person and interested in the research that we do in the LAR group, consider joining us.

### Postdocs and graduate students

It is easier to find positions if you have your own funding. However, if you think you are a particularly good fit for my group, please reach out to Yunha and we can work together to consider options.

### Undergraduates

If you are in CEE/CS/ChE/Chem, then consider doing a <b>LAR</b> research project with us.

If you are in another department, then contact Yunha about project options/ideas.

### Visitors

We are open to visitors, and you will find Pullman, WA to be a great location for a research visit.
